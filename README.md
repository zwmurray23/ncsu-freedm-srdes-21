#  Open Source Modular Compute System for Real-Time Control and Data Acquisition

Researchers working on power electronic prototypes need specialized devices for signal conditioning and control. In the past, researchers have solved this problem by creating control devices for each of their projects. They often have to recreate common circuits, and single mistakes can lead to reworks of large and expensive boards. Our solution is a modular system that can be configured for use in different projects. We have developed an open-source compute/control device made of interchangeable cards that handle I/O, signal conditioning, data acquisition, and control. Researchers can further extend the functionality of the device by swapping in cards of their own design.
